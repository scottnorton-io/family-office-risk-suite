# Discovery Call Script – Family Office Risk & Governance

> This is a guide, not a rigid script. The tone should be calm, confident, and
> conversational.

---

## 1. Opening (2–3 minutes)

**Goals:**

- Set a calm, discreet tone.
- Reinforce confidentiality.
- Clarify what we’ll cover.

**Sample opening:**

> "Thank you for taking the time today. I know your world is busy and
> confidential, so we’ll keep this focused and practical. The goal is to
> understand where you may have exposure around cyber, privacy, vendors, and
> how the office operates — and then see if it makes sense for us to help.  
> There’s no obligation today; this is about clarity first."

---

## 2. Context & Current State (10–15 minutes)

**Questions:**

- "How would you describe the structure of your family office today?"
- "What are the main priorities for the office over the next 12–24 months?"
- "Who currently owns cyber and privacy risk, if anyone?"
- "When was the last time you had an independent look at your risk posture?"

**Listen for:**

- No clear owner of cyber/privacy.
- Heavy reliance on vendors without structured review.
- Growth, new structures, or transitions (e.g., generational, MFO scaling).

---

## 3. Pain & Risk Perception (10–15 minutes)

**Questions:**

- "What worries you most when you think about digital or operational risk?"
- "Have you had any close calls or incidents in the last couple of years?"
- "Are there areas you suspect might be exposed, but haven’t had the time
  or capacity to address?"
- "On a scale from 1–10, how confident do you feel that the family’s digital
  life is well-protected today?"

**Listen for:**

- Incidents that were “handled quietly” but never fully addressed.
- Concerns around family members’ online behavior, travel, or home tech.
- Friction between how things “should” work vs how they actually work.

---

## 4. Vendors & Platforms (5–10 minutes)

**Questions:**

- "Which vendors or platforms are most critical to your operations?"
- "How do you currently evaluate vendor risk, if at all?"
- "Have you ever said ‘yes’ to a vendor mainly because there was no time or
  expertise to deeply review them?"

**Listen for:**

- Ad hoc or nonexistent vendor risk review.
- Heavy reliance on single key relationships without backup.

---

## 5. Operating Model & Human API (5–10 minutes)

**Questions:**

- "How dependent are you on one or two key people for how the office runs?"
- "If one or two people were unavailable for an extended period, what would
  worry you most?"
- "How well documented are your core processes today?"

**Listen for:**

- Concentrated knowledge and decision power.
- Limited documentation and onboarding concerns.
- Desire for continuity and succession without more bureaucracy.

---

## 6. Desired Future State (5–10 minutes)

**Questions:**

- "If we were talking 12–18 months from now, what would ‘peace of mind’ look
  like for you around these topics?"
- "What would you like to be different in how your office operates or how risk
  is handled?"

---

## 7. Positioning the Fit (5–10 minutes)

Summarize what you’ve heard:

> "Let me reflect back what I’m hearing…"

Connect to the right package types in simple language:

- Assessment and clarity first.
- Then tailored protection for people, vendors, and process.
- Option for ongoing, quiet advisory.

**Check alignment:**

- "Does that sound like the type of support you’ve been looking for, or am I
  missing something important?"

---

## 8. Next Steps & Close (3–5 minutes)

If there is clear fit:

- Propose a focused first engagement (usually the posture review).
- Outline what’s involved, rough timelines, and the level of effort required
  from them.

**Example close:**

> "The most natural first step would be a focused posture review over the next
> few weeks. We’d keep demands on your team light, and by the end you’d have a
> clear picture of where you stand and what should be prioritized.  
> If you’d like, I can follow up with a concise outline of that work, including
> scope, timeline, and fees, for you to review."

If no fit:

- Thank them, share 1–2 observations, and leave the door open for later.

> "Even if we don’t move forward now, if questions come up around risk or
> operational structure, I’m always happy to be a quiet second opinion."
