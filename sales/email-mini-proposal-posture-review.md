Hi [Name],

Thank you again for taking the time to speak with me about how your family
office is currently handling cyber, privacy, and vendor risk.

From our conversation, I heard a few themes:

- [Short bullet: e.g., No single owner for cyber/privacy risk]
- [Short bullet: e.g., Heavy reliance on key vendors and platforms]
- [Short bullet: e.g., Desire for more structure without adding complexity]

Rather than trying to address everything at once, the most natural next step
would be a focused **Family Office Cyber & Privacy Posture Review**.

In practical terms, that would give you:

- An independent view of where your real exposure lives (people, devices,
  vendors, and process)
- A concise, 2–3 page executive summary you can share internally
- A prioritized action plan for the next 90 days — what to do first, and why

We keep the process light-touch:
- A few targeted conversations with key people
- A review of core vendors and relevant documentation
- Minimal disruption to your day-to-day

If this sounds aligned with what you had in mind, I can send over a short,
formal proposal with scope, timing, and fees, and we can tune it from there.

Would you be open to that? If so, I’ll draft something for you to review.

Best,
