# Proposal: Family Office Cyber & Privacy Posture Review

## 1. Overview

This proposal outlines a focused engagement to assess the current cyber and
privacy risk posture of your family office and to provide a clear, practical
90-day action plan.

Our role is to act as a quiet, independent partner — helping you see where
you’re truly exposed, what matters most, and what to do first. We do not sell
technology or financial products; our responsibility is clarity, structure, and
protection.

---

## 2. Objectives

The objectives of this engagement are to:

- Provide an independent view of your cyber and privacy exposure across people,
  technology, vendors, and core processes.
- Identify strengths, gaps, and emerging concerns in your current posture.
- Deliver a concise, executive-ready summary and a prioritized 90-day action
  plan.
- Minimize disruption to your team and respect the confidentiality of both the
  office and the family.

## 3. Scope of Work

### 3.1 In Scope

The assessment will cover the following domains:

- **People & behavior**
  - Key staff and, where appropriate, family members’ digital habits.
- **Devices & endpoints**
  - Laptops, desktops, mobile devices, and key workstations used for office
    operations.
- **Accounts & identity**
  - Core email, collaboration, and financial-related accounts.
- **Home and travel tech (light-touch)**
  - High-level look at home office environments, Smart TVs, Wi-Fi, and similar
    components relevant to the office.
- **Vendors & platforms (initial set)**
  - A defined list of critical vendors (e.g., custodians, RIAs, CPAs, core
    WealthTech platforms).
- **Governance & process (observational)**
  - How key decisions are made, who owns risk today, and where activities rely
    heavily on a small number of people.

The exact list of systems and vendors in scope will be agreed at kickoff.

### 3.2 Out of Scope (for this phase)

This engagement does **not** include:

- Deep technical penetration testing or code review.
- Legal, tax, or regulatory advice.
- Implementation of new tools or configurations.
- Full redesign of the operating model or detailed vendor renegotiation.

These can be scoped as follow-on projects if appropriate.

## 4. Approach & Methodology

We use a structured, low-noise approach designed for family offices:

1. **Discovery & context**
   - Short conversations with key stakeholders (e.g., principal or delegate,
     CIO/COO, key staff).
   - Understanding current priorities, structure, and recent changes or events.

2. **Data gathering**
   - Light-touch request list: existing policies, high-level architecture
     diagrams (if any), vendor lists, and other relevant documentation.
   - Limited, focused interviews to avoid calendar overload.

3. **Analysis**
   - Review of people, technology, vendors, and processes within the defined
     scope.
   - Identification of strengths, gaps, and patterns of risk.
   - Mapping findings to practical impact on the family and the office.

4. **Synthesis & recommendations**
   - Development of a concise, board-ready executive summary.
   - Creation of a prioritized 90-day action plan.
   - Optional: initial longer-term considerations (6–24 months).

5. **Readout & discussion**
   - A live session (remote or in-person, as agreed) to walk through the
     findings, answer questions, and align on next steps.

## 5. Deliverables

At the conclusion of the engagement, you will receive:

1. **Executive Summary (2–3 pages)**
   - Overall risk posture.
   - Key themes and observations.
   - Top 5–10 items that warrant attention.

2. **Risk Posture Overview**
   - Simple heatmap or equivalent view across:
     - People & behavior  
     - Devices & endpoints  
     - Accounts & identity  
     - Home/travel tech (as applicable)  
     - Vendors & platforms  
     - Governance & process  

3. **Prioritized 90-Day Action Plan**
   - Clear, practical actions.
   - Suggested ownership (by role).
   - Relative effort and impact assessments.
   - Notes on dependencies or prerequisites.

4. **Optional briefing material**
   - A short slide deck suitable for internal presentation (board, committee, or
     family meeting), if requested.

All materials are prepared in clear, non-technical language suitable for
decision-makers.

## 6. Timeline

A typical Posture Review engagement follows this approximate timeline:

- **Week 1:**  
  - Kickoff meeting  
  - Finalize scope, stakeholders, and logistics  
  - Initial document and data requests  

- **Weeks 2–3:**  
  - Stakeholder interviews  
  - Documentation and vendor review  
  - Initial analysis  

- **Week 4 (and possibly Week 5 depending on availability):**  
  - Draft findings and action plan  
  - Internal quality review  

- **Final Week:**  
  - Readout session  
  - Delivery of final materials  

We will adjust pacing to fit availability and any urgent constraints you may
have.
