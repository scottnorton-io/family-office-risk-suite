# Proposal Outline – Family Office Risk & Governance Suite

This outline is a starting point for crafting proposals for HNWI, SFO, and MFO engagements.

It is intentionally concise and should be tailored to each client.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

- One or two paragraphs summarizing:
  - The context and drivers (why now).  
  - What we propose to do.  
  - The outcomes the client can expect.  

Example:

> “You have built a sophisticated ecosystem of advisors, platforms, and vendors around your family and assets. At the same time, digital, privacy, and operational risks have multiplied. Our proposal is to quietly map, stabilize, and formalize how risk and governance are handled across this ecosystem—without disrupting what already works.”

---

## 2. Objectives

Bullet the core objectives, e.g.:

- Establish a clear, decision-ready view of current risk and governance posture.  
- Reduce high-impact, avoidable risks without adding complexity or vendor fatigue.  
- Design and implement a human-first governance model that clarifies roles and escalation paths.  
- Provide ongoing advisory support for incidents and key decisions.

Tailor by segment (HNWI / SFO / MFO).

## 3. Scope of Work

Organize by phases:

1. **Phase 1 – Baseline Assessment**
   - Activities: interviews, document and configuration review, vendor mapping, governance assessment.  
   - Deliverables: baseline report, risk register, governance maturity snapshot.

2. **Phase 2 – Remediation & Stabilization**
   - Activities: remediation planning, coordination with existing IT/vendors, quick wins implementation.  
   - Deliverables: 90-day and 12-month roadmap, updated risk register, configuration/vend or recommendations.

3. **Phase 3 – Governance & Operating Model (Interacture)**
   - Activities: design and document charter, RACI, interaction maps, and governance calendar.  
   - Deliverables: governance charter, RACI, interaction maps, annual calendar.

4. **Phase 4 – Ongoing Advisory (Optional Retainer)**
   - Activities: quarterly/semi-annual reviews, incident advisory, annual refresh.  
   - Deliverables: review summaries, after-action reviews, updated governance materials.

## 4. Engagement Model & Cadence

Clarify:

- Primary points of contact (principal, family office lead, advisor).  
- Expected meeting cadence (e.g., bi-weekly during assessment, quarterly ongoing).  
- Communication channels and expectations (e.g., email, secure messaging, emergency contacts).

Refer to `docs/delivery-cadence-and-roadmap.md` for internal consistency.

---

## 5. Roles & Responsibilities

Outline at a high level:

- **Client & Advisors**
  - Provide access to relevant people and systems.  
  - Participate in key workshops and decision points.  

- **Our Team**
  - Conduct assessment and analysis.  
  - Facilitate workshops and design sessions.  
  - Recommend and help implement changes.  
  - Maintain confidentiality and discretion at all times.

Avoid overly legal language; formal terms will be in the MSA.

---

## 6. Fees & Commercials

This section will vary by client, but typical structures:

- **Fixed fee** for Phase 1 (baseline assessment).  
- **Fixed or blended fee** for Phase 2 and 3, depending on scope.  
- **Monthly/quarterly retainer** for Phase 4 (ongoing advisory).

Where appropriate, separate line items for:

- Optional tabletop exercises or special projects.  
- Additional families or entities (for MFOs).

Keep the commercial model simple and respectful of the client’s preference for clarity.

---

## 7. Timeline

Provide a simple, realistic timeline:

- Month 1–2: Intake and baseline assessment.  
- Month 2–4: Remediation and governance build-out.  
- Month 4+: Ongoing advisory and optimization (if selected).

Adjust based on actual scope and urgency.

---

## 8. Assumptions & Dependencies

List key assumptions:

- Access to key stakeholders within agreed timeframes.  
- Reasonable access to vendor representatives as needed.  
- No major undisclosed incidents currently underway.

This reduces confusion and misaligned expectations later.

---

## 9. Next Steps

Close with clear next steps, for example:

- Proposal review with principal/advisors by [date].  
- Confirmation of scope and commercial terms.  
- Kickoff call scheduling and initial document request.

This outline should be customized per client and formatted in the preferred proposal template (Word, PDF, or deck).
