# Qualification Checklist – Family Office Clients

> Aim: quickly determine whether a prospective client is a good fit for our
> services, and which package(s) make the most sense.

---

## 1. Structural Fit

- [ ] Single-family office (SFO) or multi-family office (MFO)
- [ ] High-net-worth family working through advisors
- [ ] Governance and decision-making structure is identifiable
- [ ] Size and complexity are sufficient to justify our fees

**If most boxes are unchecked:** likely not a fit or needs a different model.

---

## 2. Risk & Pain Signals

- [ ] No clear owner for cyber/privacy risk
- [ ] Recent or past incident / close call
- [ ] Principal or leadership expresses concern about exposure
- [ ] Awareness that vendor and platform risk is not well understood
- [ ] Reliance on a few key people with limited documentation

The more of these are checked, the stronger the fit.

---

## 3. Appetite for Change

- [ ] Willingness to have uncomfortable conversations about risk
- [ ] Desire for clarity, not just a checkbox
- [ ] Openness to follow through on recommendations (within reason)
- [ ] Leadership acknowledges that “we can’t keep doing it this way”

If these are missing, engagement may stall or become purely academic.

---

## 4. Engagement Constraints

- [ ] Timeline constraints (e.g., post-liquidity, succession, regulator visit)
- [ ] Geographic constraints (for any on-site work)
- [ ] Internal bandwidth constraints (scheduling, responsiveness)
- [ ] Sensitivity constraints (family dynamics, publicity concerns)

These help shape the scope and pace of the engagement.

---

## 5. Financial Fit

- [ ] Prospect understands and accepts advisory-level fee ranges
- [ ] There is budget or flexibility to create budget
- [ ] Our minimum for relevant packages is aligned with their expectations

If financial expectations are wildly misaligned, it’s better to identify that
early.

## 6. Recommended Package(s)

Based on discovery and checklist, mark likely starting fit:

- [ ] Package A – Cyber & Privacy Posture Review
- [ ] Package B – HNWI Protection Program
- [ ] Package C – Vendor & WealthTech Risk Oversight
- [ ] Package D – Interacture Operating Model & Governance
- [ ] Package E – Crisis & Incident Readiness
- [ ] Package F – Ongoing Trusted Advisory (Retainer)

---

## 7. Overall Fit Assessment

- [ ] Strong fit – proceed to proposal.
- [ ] Moderate fit – clarify scope and constraints before proposing.
- [ ] Weak fit – helpful conversation; likely not appropriate to proceed now.
