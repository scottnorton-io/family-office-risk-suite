# Qualification Checklist – Family Office Risk & Governance Suite

Use this checklist after (or during) discovery to determine:

- Whether a prospect is a good fit.
- Which package (HNWI, SFO, MFO) is most appropriate.
- What initial scope and cadence make sense.

---

## 1. Strategic Fit

- [ ] Prospect acknowledges that digital, vendor, and governance risks are real.  
- [ ] There is openness to **quiet structural improvements**, not just point fixes.  
- [ ] Prospect values privacy, discretion, and long-term relationships.  
- [ ] Existing advisors and vendors are seen as partners, not adversaries.

If most items are **unchecked**, this may not be the right moment or client.

---

## 2. Segment Fit

**HNWI / Principal (via Advisor)**

- [ ] Primary relationship is with a trusted advisor (wealth, legal, banking, etc.).  
- [ ] Principal prefers not to be directly involved in operational details.  
- [ ] Advisor is willing to champion the engagement.

**Single-Family Office (SFO)**

- [ ] Dedicated staff and processes exist to support the family.  
- [ ] There is a desire for more structure and clarity in governance and risk.  
- [ ] Leadership is open to outside specialist support.

**Multi-Family Office (MFO)**

- [ ] Platform serves multiple families with shared infrastructure and vendors.  
- [ ] Leadership is thinking about differentiation via trust, governance, or resilience.  
- [ ] There is interest in scalable frameworks and advisor enablement.

---

## 3. Pain & Urgency

- [ ] Recent or ongoing incidents (fraud attempt, vendor breach, data exposure).  
- [ ] Growth or complexity has increased (new entities, jurisdictions, families, staff).  
- [ ] Leadership changes or succession planning underway.  
- [ ] Explicit concern from principal or board about “how this is all being managed.”  

The stronger the pain and urgency, the more likely a strategic engagement will move forward.

---

## 4. Constraints & Risks

- [ ] Time: Key decision-makers have enough time/attention to engage.  
- [ ] Trust: There is a baseline of trust in advisors and key staff.  
- [ ] Politics: No severe internal conflicts likely to derail the work.  
- [ ] Legal/Regulatory: No ongoing matters that would make this engagement inappropriate at this time.

Note any red flags that might require adjusting scope or declining the engagement.

---

## 5. Initial Scope Fit

Based on discovery:

- [ ] Baseline assessment feels valuable (they want clarity).  
- [ ] There is clear appetite for remediation, not just a report.  
- [ ] Governance questions surfaced (who decides what, who owns risk).  
- [ ] Ongoing advisory would meaningfully reduce anxiety or uncertainty.

If these are mostly checked, a **phased engagement** (baseline → remediation → governance → advisory) is likely appropriate.

---

## 6. Advisor Alignment (If Applicable)

- [ ] Advisor understands and supports our role.  
- [ ] We have clarity on who “owns” the client relationship.  
- [ ] Advisor sees how this engagement strengthens, not threatens, their position.  
- [ ] Advisor is willing to be involved in key meetings and decisions.

If alignment is weak, prioritize more time with the advisor before advancing.

---

## 7. Go / No-Go / Not Now

After reviewing this checklist, classify:

- **Go:** Strong fit, clear value, alignment on approach.  
- **No-Go:** Misaligned expectations, low appetite for structural change, or significant political/ethical concerns.  
- **Not Now:** Timing, bandwidth, or other constraints suggest revisiting later.

Capture rationale briefly and store it alongside the discovery notes for future reference.
