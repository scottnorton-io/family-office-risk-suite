# Qualification Checklist – Family Office Risk Suite

This qualification tool ensures we engage with clients who fit the Family
Office Risk Suite profile, value the work, and align with our delivery model.

It is used after discovery but before sending any proposal.

# 1. Overview

A strong-fit client should score at least:

- **12+ points = Excellent fit**  
- **8–11 points = Conditional fit (proceed with caution)**  
- **0–7 points = Poor fit (likely no-go)**

Scoring is not rigid — it helps guide judgment and identify red flags.

# 4. Engagement Fit Signals

## 4.1 Strong Fit Signals
- Principal or coordinator explicitly wants “clarity,” “structure,” or “confidence.”
- Recent liquidity event, leadership change, or new advisors.
- Family exposure: travel, public profile, multiple entities.
- Advisors want a non-competing partner.
- High trust in your discretion.

## 4.2 Conditional Fit Signals
- No clear engagement owner.
- Advisors appear territorial or defensive.
- Client asks for reactive-only work.
- Office is small with low complexity (may still benefit from core Posture Review).

## 4.3 No-Go Signals
- Treats this as pure IT work.
- Only wants cybersecurity tools installed.
- No access to principals or decision makers.
- High-friction personality or “just tell me the cheapest option.”

# 5. Recommended Package Mapping

| Score Range | Recommended Package |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **12–18** | Enhanced Posture Review + Advisory options |
| **8–11** | Core Posture Review; implementation optional |
| **0–7** | Light assessment, educational brief, or referral |

This ensures client experience stays aligned with value.

---

# 6. Notes for Internal Use

- Always document **why** a “yes” or “no” decision was made.  
- Store qualification notes alongside discovery summary.  
- Red flags should be discussed openly before engagement.  
- Low-friction, respectful, motivated clients often outperform scorecard math.

This checklist is not just a filter — it is a pattern recognizer for
high-quality, low-stress engagements.
