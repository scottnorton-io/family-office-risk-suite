# Discovery Script – HNWI / SFO / MFO

This script is designed for **structured but natural discovery conversations** with:

- HNWI / principals (often via advisors)
- Single-family offices (SFOs)
- Multi-family offices (MFOs)

It is written in a conversational style; questions should be adapted to your voice and the specific context.

---

## 1. Opening & Framing

**Goal:** Set a calm, non-alarmist tone and clarify the purpose of the conversation.

Suggested framing:

> “Thank you for taking the time. The goal of this conversation is to understand how your world is set up today—digitally, operationally, and from a governance standpoint—so we can see where quiet improvements might reduce risk and simplify decisions. This is not an audit. It’s a chance to map what’s working, where there’s friction, and what ‘better’ would look like for you.”

Confirm:

- Time available  
- Who is in the room and their roles  
- Any topics that are off-limits for now  

---

## 2. Context & Objectives

**Key Questions:**

- “What prompted this conversation now?”  
- “If we were looking back a year from now, what would need to be true for you to feel this was worthwhile?”  
- “How would you describe your current approach to cyber, privacy, and vendor risk today?”  
- “Are there specific incidents or near-misses that have shaped how you think about this?”  

Listen for:

- Recent fraud attempts, compromises, or vendor failures.  
- Underlying anxiety: what keeps them up at night.  
- Constraints: time, attention, appetite for change.

## 3. Environment Overview

Tailor depth based on segment (HNWI vs SFO vs MFO).

**General prompts:**

- “Can you describe the main entities and structures we should be aware of? (e.g., operating companies, trusts, foundations, holding companies)”  
- “Who are the key advisors and providers involved? (e.g., wealth managers, private banks, lawyers, accountants, CIOs, IT providers)”  
- “What are the main systems where important decisions or transactions happen? (Wealth platforms, banking portals, file sharing, messaging, etc.)”

For SFO/MFO:

- “How is your family office or platform structured from a people and process perspective?”  
- “How do new vendors or tools get evaluated and approved today?”

## 4. Cyber & Privacy Posture

**Prompts:**

- “How do you think about protecting accounts, devices, and information today?”  
- “Do you have a person or firm you’d say ‘owns’ cyber and privacy for you?”  
- “Have there been any security measures that felt especially disruptive or unhelpful?”  

If comfortable, lightly explore:

- MFA usage and enforcement.  
- Shared passwords or accounts.  
- Device and network basics (home, office, travel).

Focus on experience, not technical details.

---

## 5. Vendor & WealthTech Risk

**Prompts:**

- “Which platforms and vendors feel most critical to you today?”  
- “Have you ever had an issue with a vendor that made you question how they manage risk?”  
- “How do you decide when to change or retire a vendor or platform?”  

For MFO:

- “How consistent are risk practices across the families you serve?”  
- “Do advisors feel confident talking about digital and operational risk with clients?”

---

## 6. Governance & Decision-Making (Interacture Angle)

**Prompts:**

- “When something important comes up—like a possible fraud issue, a new platform, or a sensitive data request—who is typically involved in the decision?”  
- “Who is the first call when something feels off?”  
- “Are there decisions that feel bottlenecked or unclear?”  

Look for:

- Informal patterns (“we always call X first”).  
- Situations where people are unsure they’re allowed to act.  
- Scenarios where everything depends on one or two people.

---

## 7. Incidents, Near Misses, and “What Ifs”

**Prompts:**

- “Without naming names if you prefer, have there been incidents or near-misses in the last few years that stood out?”  
- “If something serious happened tomorrow—a major fraud attempt, a vendor breach, or an extortion demand—how confident do you feel in your current playbook?”  
- “Is there a scenario that quietly worries you more than others?”  

The goal is not to dramatize but to understand where they feel exposed or unprepared.

---

## 8. Appetite for Change

**Prompts:**

- “On a scale from ‘minimal change’ to ‘let’s fix this properly,’ where do you see yourself right now?”  
- “What kinds of changes would be acceptable, and what would feel like too much disruption?”  
- “Who else needs to be comfortable with the plan for this to move forward?”  

This is crucial for shaping a right-sized proposal.

## 9. Closing the Conversation

Summarize what you heard:

- Key concerns.  
- Areas of strength.  
- Where a structured engagement could help.

Suggested close:

> “Here’s what I’m hearing: [reflect back]. Our role would be to quietly map this, reduce the most important risks, and put a simple governance and decision structure around it—without overwhelming anyone or disrupting what already works. The next step would be for us to put together a short, scoped proposal that outlines what we’d do in the first 60–90 days and what you’d get out of it. Would that be helpful?”

Confirm:

- Who will review the proposal.  
- Any constraints (timing, confidentiality, logistics).  
- Preferred follow-up method and timing.
