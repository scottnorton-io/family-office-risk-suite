# Vision – Family Office Risk Suite

## 1. Purpose

The Family Office Risk Suite exists to give family offices a **calm, clear,
and independent view of risk** across:

- People and behavior  
- Technology and data  
- Vendors and platforms  
- Governance and decision-making  

Our goal is not to sell tools or fear. Our goal is to:

> Quietly help family offices protect what and who they care about,  
> with just enough structure to be safe and resilient.

## 2. Who This Is For

### 2.1 Primary Audience

- Single-family offices (SFOs)
- Multi-family offices (MFOs)
- High-net-worth families who operate through multiple advisors

They typically have:

- Significant assets and complexity  
- A lean internal team  
- Heavy reliance on vendors and platforms  
- Limited internal cyber/privacy/compliance capacity  

### 2.2 Secondary Audience

- Trusted advisors to family offices:
  - RIAs and wealth managers
  - Estate planning attorneys
  - CPAs and tax advisors
  - Private bankers and trust officers

For them, the suite is:

- A way to **protect and deepen** their client relationships  
- A way to demonstrate proactive stewardship around risk  
- A partner that complements, rather than competes with, their core services

## 3. The Problem We Are Solving

Family offices face a unique combination of problems:

1. **High consequence, low margin for error**  
   - A single incident can have financial, reputational, and personal fallout.

2. **Blended environments**  
   - Personal and professional systems blur together (devices, accounts, home
     tech, travel).

3. **Invisible complexity**  
   - Vendors, platforms, and advisors are connected in ways that are hard to see
     and manage holistically.

4. **No clear owner for risk**  
   - Cyber, privacy, and governance topics often sit between IT, legal, tax,
     and investment advisors.

5. **Ad-hoc response to incidents and change**  
   - Near-misses and incidents are handled as one-offs, without structural
     learning.

We are building a suite that **brings order to this complexity** without
drowning anyone in jargon or dashboards.

## 4. Our Approach

### 4.1 Principles

- **Human-first, tool-agnostic**  
  We focus on people, decisions, and structures first. Technology is a means,
  not the starting point.

- **Quiet and discreet**  
  We aim to be nearly invisible from the outside and low-noise on the inside.

- **Plain language**  
  We translate technical and compliance concepts into straightforward language
  that principals and leadership can act on.

- **Practical over perfect**  
  We prefer meaningful, staged improvements over theoretical “best practice”
  that never lands.

- **Independent and non-conflicted**  
  We do not manage assets or sell platforms. Our incentives are aligned with
  clarity and protection.

### 4.2 Framework

We frame family office risk around six components:

1. **People** – behavior, awareness, and roles  
2. **Technology** – devices, systems, networks, and data flows  
3. **Vendors** – custodians, RIAs, CPAs, WealthTech, and other providers  
4. **Governance** – how decisions are made and work gets done  
5. **Incidents** – how the office prepares for and handles bad days  
6. **Ongoing Advisory** – how risk is monitored and revisited over time  

All services, content, and tools in this repo should connect clearly to one or
more of these components.

## 5. What Success Looks Like

We are “on mission” when:

- Family offices:
  - Have a **clear, shared picture** of their risk posture.  
  - Know **what to do first** and why.  
  - Experience **fewer surprises** and less chaos when something goes wrong.  
  - Feel that risk and governance are “handled” without becoming bureaucratic.

- Advisors:
  - Feel **relief**, not competition, when we are involved.  
  - Can confidently say they’ve helped clients address real risk.  
  - See fewer messy emergencies that could have been prevented.

- Internally:
  - We can deliver engagements **consistently** using the templates and
    playbooks in this repo.  
  - New team members or collaborators can ramp quickly using these documents.  
  - We can adapt the same patterns to adjacent domains (e.g. other types of
    risk or frameworks) without starting from scratch.

  - Service catalog (`docs/service-catalog.md`)
  - Packages and pricing bands (`docs/packages-and-pricing.md`)
  - Roadmap (`docs/roadmap.md`)

- External-facing assets:
  - Website copy (`marketing/website-section-family-offices.md`)
  - One-pagers and partner packs (`marketing/*`)
  - Briefing deck content (`marketing/family-office-risk-briefing-deck.md`)

- Sales assets:
  - Discovery scripts and qualification (`sales/*`)
  - Proposal/SOW templates (`sales/proposal-*.md`)

Anything that is needed to **sell, deliver, and evolve** the Family Office Risk
Suite should live here.

## 7. Future Directions

Over time, this repo may expand to include:

- Light automation or checklists (e.g., JSON/YAML for task generators).
- Mappings to specific frameworks (e.g., PCI, ISO, NIST) where relevant.
- Training content for internal team members or trusted partners.
- Variants of the suite for adjacent audiences:
  - Entrepreneurial family groups
  - Single-issue topics (e.g., HNWI travel security, Smart home privacy)

Any such expansion should:

- Stay aligned with the principles in this document.  
- Be added to the repo **intentionally**, with updates to:
  - `docs/repo-structure-and-conventions.md`
  - `docs/roadmap.md` (as needed)

---

## 8. How to Use This Document

- When making **strategic decisions** (new services, new content, new offers),
  check them against this vision.
- When in doubt about **fit** or **scope**, prefer:
  - Clarity over breadth  
  - Depth over generic coverage  
  - Simplicity over cleverness  
- Update this document if the mission or audience meaningfully shift.

This is the north star for the Family Office Risk Suite.
