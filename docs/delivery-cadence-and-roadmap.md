# Delivery Cadence & Roadmap

This document describes the **standard delivery cadence** and high-level **roadmap** for Family Office Risk & Governance engagements.

It is intended for internal use to keep our delivery consistent, predictable, and high quality across clients.

---

## 1. Standard Engagement Phases

We structure most engagements into four phases:

1. **Intake & Orientation**
2. **Baseline Assessment**
3. **Remediation & Governance Build-Out**
4. **Ongoing Advisory & Optimization**

### 1.1 Intake & Orientation (Weeks 0–2)

**Objectives:**

- Understand the client’s context, expectations, and constraints.
- Align on scope, communication patterns, and decision-making dynamics.

**Key Activities:**

- Kickoff meeting with principal and/or key stakeholders.
- Intake questionnaire and document collection.
- Clarify any special sensitivities or “no-go zones.”

**Outputs:**

- Confirmed scope and assumptions.
- Communication plan (who we talk to, how often, and via which channels).
- Initial view of priorities and time-critical items.

### 1.2 Baseline Assessment (Weeks 2–6+)

**Objectives:**

- Build a clear, decision-ready picture of the current risk and governance posture.

**Key Activities:**

- Interviews with family office staff, advisors, and relevant vendors.
- Review of current controls, configurations, and vendor contracts (as appropriate).
- Privacy and digital footprint review.
- Governance and operating model assessment (using Interacture).

**Outputs:**

- Baseline assessment report.
- Initial risk register with prioritized items.
- Draft governance maturity snapshot.

### 1.3 Remediation & Governance Build-Out (Weeks 6–16+)

**Objectives:**

- Execute a realistic, high-impact set of improvements.
- Establish a durable governance model and cadence.

**Key Activities:**

- Work with existing IT / security partners to implement changes.
- Design and finalize governance artifacts (charter, RACI, calendar).
- Run at least one governance or incident tabletop exercise (if in scope).

**Outputs:**

- 90-day remediation plan and progress tracking.
- Updated risk register with residual risk view.
- Finalized governance charter, RACI, and calendar.

### 1.4 Ongoing Advisory & Optimization (Retainer)

**Objectives:**

- Provide a quiet, expert “second set of eyes.”
- Adapt the governance model as circumstances change.

**Key Activities:**

- Quarterly or semi-annual risk/governance review sessions.
- On-call incident advisory (per contract).
- Annual governance refresh and scenario planning.

**Outputs:**

- Quarterly or semi-annual reports.
- After-action reviews (AARs) following incidents or tabletop exercises.
- Updated governance documents and playbooks as needed.

## 2. Cadence by Client Segment

### 2.1 HNWI / Principal

- **Primary interface:** Trusted advisor.
- **Review cadence:** Typically semi-annual or annual, unless otherwise agreed.
- **Preferred communication:** Short briefings, advisor-led.

### 2.2 Single-Family Office (SFO)

- **Primary interface:** Family office leadership and key staff.
- **Review cadence:** Quarterly governance & risk reviews.
- **Preferred communication:** Working sessions plus concise executive summaries.

### 2.3 Multi-Family Office (MFO)

- **Primary interface:** MFO leadership + designated risk/governance leads.
- **Review cadence:** Quarterly program reviews, with family-level flexibility.
- **Preferred communication:** Framework updates, metrics, and advisor enablement.

## 3. Roadmap Alignment

For each client, we maintain a simple roadmap document (or Notion/Fieldguide equivalent) that captures:

- **Short-term (0–90 days):**  
  - Urgent risk reductions and quick wins.
  - Any critical vendor or configuration changes.

- **Medium-term (3–12 months):**  
  - Governance build-out and stabilization.
  - Education and cultural change.

- **Long-term (1–3 years):**  
  - Strategic modernization projects (e.g., platform changes).
  - Evolving risk landscape (new threats, regulations, or geographies).

This roadmap is used to anchor quarterly/annual reviews and to prevent “scope drift” from reactive, one-off tasks.

---

## 4. Quality Checks & Exit Criteria

Each phase has **exit criteria** to confirm we have achieved the desired outcome.

- **Intake & Orientation complete when:**
  - Scope is clear and agreed.
  - Communication and escalation paths are defined.

- **Baseline Assessment complete when:**
  - Assessment report and risk register are delivered and reviewed.
  - Governance maturity snapshot is agreed.

- **Remediation & Governance Build-Out complete when:**
  - Majority of agreed high-priority items are addressed or consciously deferred.
  - Governance artifacts are finalized and accepted.

- **Ongoing Advisory running healthily when:**
  - Cadence is consistent and trusted.
  - Issues are surfaced early, not late.
  - The client expresses confidence and reduced anxiety about risk.

## 5. Internal Notes

- This cadence is a **default**, not a rigid rule. We adapt to client needs while preserving structure.
- Significant deviations (e.g., highly compressed timelines) should be documented with risk trade-offs.
- This document should be kept in sync with the `ops/` playbooks that define the details of each step.
