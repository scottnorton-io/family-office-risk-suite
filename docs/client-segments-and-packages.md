# Client Segments & Packages

This document defines the **segment-specific packages** for:

- High-net-worth individuals (HNWI / principals)
- Single-family offices (SFO)
- Multi-family offices (MFO)

Each package builds from the **core workstreams** in `service-catalog.md` and can be customized per client.

---

## 1. HNWI / Principal Package (via Trusted Advisor)

**Ideal for:**  
Principals and families with meaningful wealth who rely on a **trusted advisor** (investment, legal, banking, or family office-lite) and want quiet, expert help without building an internal security function.

### 1.1 Objectives

- Reduce personal, household, and digital risk without overwhelming the principal.
- Equip the trusted advisor with clear, simple options and recommendations.
- Avoid vendor fatigue and “security theater.”

### 1.2 Scope

- Targeted baseline risk & privacy review (personal + household + key vendors).
- Short, prioritized remediation plan (focus on quiet, high-impact moves).
- Governance-lite: clarify who handles what in incidents and routine decisions.
- Ongoing advisory via the trusted advisor (not directly to the principal unless requested).

### 1.3 Deliverables

- 3–5 page **Executive Risk Brief** (plain language).
- 90-day **Remediation Plan** with owners (often the advisor + existing IT).
- **Vendor & WealthTech Snapshot** (key accounts and priority actions).
- **Advisory Channel Guide** – how and when the advisor should loop us in.

### 1.4 Engagement Pattern

- Initial assessment project (4–8 weeks, depending on complexity).
- Optional follow-on retainer:
  - Quarterly check-ins with the advisor.
  - Ad hoc incident advisory (defined response window).

## 2. Single-Family Office (SFO) Package

**Ideal for:**  
Established single-family offices with dedicated staff and a mix of internal and external vendors, where roles and accountability for cyber, privacy, and operational risk are not fully defined or cohesive.

### 2.1 Objectives

- Build a clear, integrated view of risk across the family office ecosystem.
- Establish a governance and operating model that survives leadership changes.
- Reduce dependence on any single vendor or person for key risk decisions.

### 2.2 Scope

- Comprehensive baseline assessment:
  - Office systems, workflows, data flows.
  - Household + staff whose roles intersect with the office.
  - WealthTech stack, banks, custodians, and key vendors.
- Governance & operating model design (Interacture-based Human API).
- Remediation & stabilization roadmap (90-day and 12-month horizons).
- Ongoing advisory retainer: reviews, incidents, and strategy support.

### 2.3 Deliverables

- Detailed **Risk & Governance Assessment Report**.
- **Governance Charter & RACI Map** (family, office, advisors, vendors).
- **Annual Governance Calendar** – reviews, exercises, and updates.
- **Remediation & Stabilization Plan** with clear owners and sequencing.
- Optional: **Family Education Session** (or series).

### 2.4 Engagement Pattern

- Initial comprehensive engagement (typically multi-month).
- Retainer with:
  - Quarterly governance & risk review sessions.
  - Incident readiness check-ins and tabletop exercises.
  - On-call advisory for material events.

## 3. Multi-Family Office (MFO) Package

**Ideal for:**  
MFO platforms serving multiple families, where consistent risk and governance practices are needed across the client base – and where differentiated risk governance can be a **competitive advantage**.

### 3.1 Objectives

- Design a **platform-level risk & governance framework** for all families.
- Equip advisors with playbooks and tools to talk about risk confidently.
- Allow the MFO to offer a premium risk governance layer to its families.

### 3.2 Scope

- Review of the MFO’s operating model, vendor stack, and advisor workflows.
- Design of a modular, repeatable framework that can be applied per family.
- Creation of advisor-facing and client-facing collateral.
- Pilot program with a group of families and refinement.

### 3.3 Deliverables

- **MFO Risk & Governance Framework** (playbook + visuals).
- **Advisor Enablement Kit**:
  - Conversation guides.
  - Presentation decks.
  - One-page explainer sheets.
- **Family-Level Templates**:
  - Baseline assessment and summary reports.
  - Governance snapshot and action plans.
- Optional: **Training sessions** for advisors and staff.

### 3.4 Engagement Pattern

- Design and pilot phase (several months, with defined milestones).
- Ongoing advisory to maintain and update the framework.
- Optional: periodic “program health” reviews and metrics reports.

## 4. Custom / Special Situations

We also support **special situations** and bespoke projects:

- Pre-transaction risk and governance reviews (e.g., liquidity events).
- Post-incident recovery and governance redesign.
- Succession-related governance changes.
- New geography or regulatory exposure.

These should still be built from the **core modules** defined in `service-catalog.md` to maintain consistency and quality.

---

## 5. Package Guardrails

To maintain a platinum-level experience:

- **No “random acts of consulting.”** Every engagement is anchored in the core workstreams and modules.
- **Protect the principal’s attention.** We filter complexity and triage noise through the advisor or office where possible.
- **Respect existing relationships.** We coordinate with current IT, security, and legal providers instead of trying to replace them by default.
- **Document decisions.** Key decisions, assumptions, and residual risk acceptance are captured and revisited.

This document should be updated as we refine pricing, patterns, and preferred engagement models.
