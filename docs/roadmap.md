# Roadmap – Family Office Risk Suite

This roadmap outlines the phases, priorities, and sequencing for the Family
Office Risk Suite. It ensures that strategy, marketing, sales, and delivery
assets evolve in a structured and consistent way.

The roadmap is divided into four phases:

1. **Foundation (v1.0) – DONE / IN PROGRESS**
2. **Pilot (v1.1)**
3. **Refinement (v1.2)**
4. **Scale (v2.0+)**

## 5. Roadmap Maintenance

The roadmap should be updated when:
- A new service is added
- A file is renamed/moved
- We complete a new phase
- We change ICP targeting or positioning

This roadmap ties directly to:
- The files defined in `docs/repo-structure-and-conventions.md`
- The strategic goals in `docs/vision.md`
