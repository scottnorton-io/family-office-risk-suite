# Packages and Pricing – Family Office Risk Suite

This document defines the standard packages, pricing bands, and engagement
structures for the Family Office Risk Suite. Pricing is intentionally presented
as **bands**, not rigid numbers, to support discreet and context-aware quoting.

# 1. Overview

We offer three primary engagement paths:

1. **Posture Review (Assessment)** – A structured deep-dive across People,
   Technology, Vendors, Governance, and Incidents.
2. **Implementation Support (Optional)** – Guided execution of recommended
   improvements.
3. **Ongoing Advisory (Retainer)** – Quarterly or monthly support providing
   structure, continuity, and a trusted touchpoint.

Packages are designed to be simple for families, advisors, and family offices.
