# Family Office Risk & Governance Service Catalog

This catalog defines the core services, modules, and engagement patterns for the Family Office Risk & Governance Suite.

It is organized by **client segment** and **workstream** so that we can:

- Quickly assemble an engagement scope.
- Keep language consistent across marketing, sales, and delivery.
- Ensure we deliver a platinum-level experience to HNWI, SFO, and MFO clients.

## 1. Client Segments & Lanes

We primarily serve three lanes:

1. **HNWI / Principal (via Trusted Advisor)**
   - Primary relationship is with a wealth manager, investment advisor, private banker, or legal counsel.
   - Our role: a **quiet, expert extension** of their advisor team.

2. **Single-Family Office (SFO)**
   - Dedicated office and staff serving a single family.
   - Our role: a **specialist overlay** for cyber, privacy, vendor, and governance risk.

3. **Multi-Family Office (MFO)**
   - A firm serving multiple families, often with complex tech stacks and vendor ecosystems.
   - Our role: a **repeatable, scalable risk and governance partner**, integrated into their platform.

Segment-specific package details are defined in `client-segments-and-packages.md`.

## 2. Core Workstreams

### 2.1 Baseline Risk & Governance Assessment

**Objective:** Establish a clear, decision-ready view of current risk exposure and governance maturity across personal, household, and office environments.

**Key Components:**

- Digital footprint & privacy exposure review.
- Endpoint, identity, and network posture (household, office, travel).

- Governance maturity assessment (how decisions are made, who is responsible for what).

**Deliverables:**

- Executive summary (3–5 pages, decision-ready).
- Risk register with prioritized actions (90-day and 12-month lens).
- Governance maturity snapshot and recommendations.

### 2.2 Remediation & Stabilization

**Objective:** Reduce risk quickly with minimal disruption, focusing on “quiet wins” that materially improve security and privacy.

**Key Components:**

- Targeted remediation plan (prioritized by impact vs. friction).
- Vendor and WealthTech hardening (MFA, alerting, access reviews).

- Coordination with existing IT/security providers where applicable.

**Deliverables:**

- Cadence: quarterly risk/governance reviews, annual deep dive.
- Minimum documentation set (charter, RACI, communication protocols).

**Deliverables:**

- Governance charter and RACI map.

- Annual calendar of governance events (reviews, exercises, updates).

### 2.4 Ongoing Advisory & Incident Readiness

**Objective:** Provide an ongoing “quiet guardian” function for the family and office, with on-call support for material risk events.

**Key Components:**

- Retainer-based advisory (defined hours and response expectations).

- Incident readiness: tabletop exercises, playbooks, war-room protocols.
- Coordination with legal, insurers, and other professional advisors.
