# Family Office Risk & Governance Suite

This repository contains the strategy, service design, and go-to-market assets
for our family office offering.

We quietly help family offices reduce cyber, privacy, and operational risk
without adding noise, complexity, or vendor fatigue.

## Objective

- Single-family offices (SFOs)

- High-net-worth individuals (HNWI) via their trusted advisors

The focus is on:

- Cyber & privacy risk posture
- Vendor and WealthTech risk oversight
- Governance and operating model (Human API / Interacture)
- Incident readiness and ongoing advisory
