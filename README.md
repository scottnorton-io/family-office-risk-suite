# Family Office Risk & Governance Suite

We quietly help family offices and their trusted advisors reduce **cyber, privacy, and operational risk** without adding noise, complexity, or vendor fatigue.

This repository contains the **strategy, service design, and go-to-market assets** for our family office offering.

## Who This Is For

- **HNWI / Principal** – Typically served via their **trusted advisor** or wealth manager.
- **Single-Family Offices (SFO)** – Centralized support for a single family with complex structures.
- **Multi-Family Offices (MFO)** – Scaled support across multiple families, often with complex vendor ecosystems.

We focus on:

- **Cyber & privacy risk posture** (personal + enterprise + household)
- **Vendor and WealthTech risk oversight**
- **Governance and operating model** (Human API / Interacture)
- **Incident readiness and ongoing advisory**

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` – Vision, service catalog, segment-specific packages, and operating model.
- `marketing/` – Positioning, one-pager copy, messaging pillars, and partner collateral.
- `sales/` – Discovery scripts, qualification checklists, and proposal templates.
- `ops/` – Delivery playbooks, assessment templates, reporting frameworks, and retainer guidelines.

Each directory is designed to be *implementation-ready* for use with new and prospective clients.

## Service Philosophy

1. **Quiet by default**  
   We operate in the background, respect existing advisor relationships, and avoid adding vendor noise.

2. **Human-first, tech-augmented**  
   Tools and automation support our work, but decisions and guidance remain human, contextual, and judgment-driven.

3. **No jargon – decision-ready language**  
   Principals and advisors receive clear, concise, risk-informed recommendations, not security theater.

4. **Repeatable, scalable patterns**  
   Everything here is designed to be repeatable across HNWI, SFO, and MFO clients with minimal rework.

## Workstreams

The Family Office Risk & Governance Suite is organized into four primary workstreams:

1. **Baseline Risk & Governance Assessment**
   - Personal and household cyber/privacy posture
   - Family office / advisory firm environment
   - WealthTech and key vendor risk
   - Governance and decision-making maturity (Interacture)

2. **Remediation & Stabilization**
   - High-impact, low-friction improvements
   - Prioritized roadmap with owners and timelines
   - Vendor changes or configuration hardening where needed

3. **Governance & Operating Model**
   - Clear roles and decision rights across family, office, and vendors
   - Interacture-powered “Human API” for how people work together
   - Cadence of reviews, reporting, and escalation paths

4. **Ongoing Advisory & Incident Readiness**
   - Retainer-based advisory and “second set of eyes”
   - Tabletop exercises and incident simulations
   - On-call guidance for material events (breach, fraud, extortion, etc.)

These workstreams are defined in detail in `docs/service-catalog.md` and implemented via the playbooks in `ops/`.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Strategy & Design** – Start in `docs/` to understand the offer, segments, and operating model.
- **Client Acquisition** – Use `marketing/` and `sales/` assets to support outreach and advisory-led introductions.
- **Delivery** – Follow the playbooks and templates in `ops/` to run assessments, produce reports, and run ongoing retainers.

This should be treated as the **source of truth** for the Family Office Risk & Governance Suite.

---

## Status & Roadmap

- Phase 1 – Service definition and packaging – **complete (v1.0 baseline)**  
- Phase 2 – Collateral creation & refinement – **ongoing (see `marketing/` and `sales/`)**  
- Phase 3 – Go-to-market and pilot clients – **in progress**

Changes to this repository should be made via pull requests and tracked as part of the broader RegulaGuide / Interacture platform roadmap.
