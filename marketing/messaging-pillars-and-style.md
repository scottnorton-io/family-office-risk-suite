# Messaging Pillars & Style Guide (External)

This guide defines how we **talk about** the Family Office Risk & Governance Suite in external-facing contexts (web, decks, conversations).

It is written to support platinum-level consistency across all marketing and sales touchpoints.

## 1. Core Messaging Pillars

1. **Quiet Expertise**  
   We are calm, discreet, and highly capable. We don’t shout. We don’t sell fear. We quietly make things safer and clearer.

2. **Human-First Governance**  
   Our work is about how people make decisions under stress. Technology matters, but governance and clarity matter more.

3. **Advisor-Aligned**  
   We work through and alongside the client’s trusted advisors. We protect and enhance those relationships.

4. **Decision-Ready Outcomes**  
   Everything we produce should help someone make a decision, not just “raise awareness.”

5. **Durable Structures, Not One-Off Fixes**  
   We design operating models and governance structures that survive changes in vendors, staff, or even jurisdictions.

## 2. Tone of Voice

- **Calm, grounded, confident** – never panicked or sensational.  
- **Plain language** – minimal jargon; if a technical term is needed, briefly explain it.  
- **Respectful and discreet** – assume highly private people are reading.  
- **Practical and specific** – clear examples instead of vague claims.  
- **Non-judgmental** – we meet clients where they are; no shaming for past choices.

Avoid:

- Overly clever metaphors that trivialize serious risks.  
- Aggressive fear-based marketing.  
- Overpromising or guaranteeing outcomes.

## 3. Key Phrases & Frames

Phrases we like:

- “Quiet, expert oversight for modern wealth.”  
- “Reduce risk without adding noise or vendor fatigue.”  
- “Human-first, tech-augmented governance.”  
- “Decision-ready, not jargon-heavy.”  
- “A second set of eyes for your digital, vendor, and governance risk.”  

Frames we use:

- **From chaos to cadence** – taking scattered security actions and shaping them into a stable governance rhythm.  
- **From personalities to structure** – moving beyond “this only works because of one person” to durable models.  
- **From reactive to prepared** – reducing panic when something goes wrong by having clear playbooks.

## 4. What We Avoid Saying

Avoid:

- “We guarantee you won’t be hacked.”  
- “We replace your advisors/IT/security team.”  
- “This is a turnkey solution for all risk.”  

Instead, say:

- “We materially reduce your exposure and give you a clear plan.”  
- “We complement your existing advisors and vendors.”  
- “We focus on the parts of risk and governance that matter most for how you live and operate.”

---

## 5. Visual & Structural Guidance (for Decks and One-Pagers)

- Clean layouts, generous whitespace, and limited color palette.  
- No stock imagery that feels cheesy (e.g., hooded hackers, dollar bills, generic families).  
- Prefer:
  - Abstract but calm imagery (e.g., horizon lines, architecture, subtle geometric patterns).  
  - Photos that feel like **real working environments** (boardrooms, offices, quiet spaces).
- Use short sections, bold headings, and simple icons if needed.

## 6. Example Elevator Descriptions

**Short (1 sentence)**  
> “We quietly help family offices and their advisors reduce digital, vendor, and governance risk without adding noise.”

**Medium (2–3 sentences)**  
> “We design and run a modern risk and governance layer for families and family offices. That means clear roles, simple playbooks, and practical improvements to how your digital life, vendors, and decisions are managed. We operate behind the scenes, usually through your existing advisors.”

**Long (for website or brochure intro)**  
> “Modern wealth lives across banks, custodians, WealthTech platforms, personal devices, home networks, and a growing list of vendors and staff. We help family offices and their advisors quietly bring order to that complexity. Through assessments, remediation, governance design, and ongoing advisory, we build a durable risk and governance layer around the family and the office—human-first, tech-augmented, and deeply respectful of existing relationships.”

## 7. Consistency Checklist

Before releasing any external content, confirm:

- [ ] Tone is calm, confident, and clear.  
- [ ] Messaging aligns with the pillars above.  
- [ ] No accidental overpromises or guarantees.  
- [ ] Advisors are framed as central, not optional.  
- [ ] Privacy and discretion are implied or explicitly acknowledged.

This guide should be updated as we learn which language resonates most with our clients and partners.
