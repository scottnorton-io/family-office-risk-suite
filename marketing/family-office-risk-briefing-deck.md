## Slide 1 — Title Slide  
**Title:** Family Office Risk Briefing  
**Subtitle:** Quiet clarity on cyber, privacy, vendor, and human risk  
**Footer:** [Your brand name] | Confidential

**Speaker Notes:**  
This briefing is designed to give you a clear, structured view of where modern
family offices are most exposed — and what actually matters. It’s deliberately
non-technical, practical, and focused on real-world patterns we see across
families of all sizes.

---

## Slide 2 — Why We’re Here  
**Headline:** Family offices face unique forms of risk  
- High visibility  
- High concentration of assets  
- High dependency on people  
- Low margin for error  
- Increasing complexity of vendors, tech, and data flows

**Speaker Notes:**  
Family offices are unlike traditional businesses: the stakes are higher,
privacy is more critical, and structures are often lean. This combination
creates risk patterns that aren’t obvious but can be extremely consequential.

---

## Slide 3 — The Four Major Categories of Risk  
**Headline:** A simple model: People, Technology, Vendors, Governance  
- **People**: staff, family members, advisors  
- **Technology**: devices, networks, accounts, cloud, IoT  
- **Vendors**: custodians, RIAs, WealthTech, portals, CPA/Tax  
- **Governance**: roles, decision flows, “how things actually get done”

**Speaker Notes:**  
Every incident we’ve responded to — phishing, account compromise, ransomware,
vendor failure, internal miscommunication — fits neatly into these four
categories. This becomes our framework for assessing and prioritizing risk.

---

## Slide 4 — The Real-World Pattern  
**Headline:** Most family office crises have *nothing* to do with hackers  
- Accidental wire transfers  
- Vendor configuration failures  
- MFA not enforced  
- Staff turnover with undocumented knowledge  
- Family member exposure on social media  
- Lost or stolen devices  
- Oversharing with advisors or vendors  
- Password reuse  
- Lack of a “single source of truth”

**Speaker Notes:**  
When the headlines talk about cyberattacks, it sounds like the threats are
high-tech. But the most common — and expensive — incidents are *low-tech,
human, and process-related*.

---

## Slide 5 — The Family Office Attack Surface  
**Headline:** High complexity. Low visibility.  
- Multiple devices across multiple locations  
- Personal + professional systems blended  
- Smart TVs, IoT, home networks  
- Travel patterns and geopolitical exposure  
- Vendors with access to sensitive data  
- Advisors who outsource to *their* vendors  
- Increasing reliance on WealthTech platforms  
- No unified view of all risks across the ecosystem

**Speaker Notes:**  
Most family offices don’t know how many active devices, accounts, or vendors
they have. And that’s normal — but it’s also where risk hides.

---

## Slide 6 — Case Study (Anonymized)  
**Headline:** A simple oversight cost a family office seven figures  
- Trusted vendor had MFA disabled  
- Account compromised  
- Wire fraud attempt succeeded  
- Took days to detect  
- Insurance dispute followed  
- Reputational impact to principal

**Speaker Notes:**  
Real example (lightly anonymized). Zero malware. Zero advanced threat actors.
Purely a configuration + oversight issue.

---

## Slide 7 — Case Study (Anonymized)  
**Headline:** A principal’s phone compromise cascaded into the office  
- SIM swap attack during travel  
- Email accounts locked  
- Trading instructions delayed  
- Personal data leaked  
- Required coordinated recovery effort

**Speaker Notes:**  
Again — common, preventable issues. But without the right structures in place,
a personal incident becomes an office incident.

---

## Slide 8 — What “Good” Looks Like  
**Headline:** You don’t need perfection — you need structure  
- Clear roles and responsibilities  
- Minimum viable security standards  
- Clean vendor oversight  
- Device and account hardening  
- Documented workflows  
- Basic incident playbooks  
- Regular, quiet touchpoints

**Speaker Notes:**  
Family offices don’t need enterprise security. They need smart, simple,
repeatable defenses tailored to their people and operating model.

---

## Slide 9 — Our Framework  
**Headline:** The Family Office Security & Risk Framework  
1. People  
2. Technology  
3. Vendors  
4. Governance  
5. Incidents  
6. Ongoing Advisory

**Speaker Notes:**  
This framework is intentionally minimal. It’s designed so that leadership,
principals, and staff have a shared mental model — a common language for risk.

---

## Slide 10 — Step 1: Posture Assessment  
**Headline:** The fastest path to clarity  
- Interviews  
- Light-touch documentation review  
- Vendor snapshot  
- Device and account hygiene  
- Social and privacy exposure  
- Governance “reality mapping”

**Speaker Notes:**  
This is your 30-day reset. It gives us a unified view of what’s strong, what’s
fragile, and where risk is hiding.

---

## Slide 11 — Step 2: 90-Day Action Plan  
**Headline:** Clear, prioritized, achievable  
- High-impact items first  
- Assign clear ownership  
- Minimal technical jargon  
- “Do this → Here’s why” structure  
- Designed for your team, not a generic checklist

**Speaker Notes:**  
This plan becomes the tactical roadmap for the next quarter.

---

## Slide 12 — Step 3: Vendor & WealthTech Oversight  
**Headline:** Confidence in the platforms and providers you rely on  
- Custodians  
- RIAs  
- WealthTech  
- CPA/Tax  
- Legal  
- Trust companies

**Speaker Notes:**  
We translate their claims — SOC 2, ISO, PCI, etc. — into what it means for *you*.

---

## Slide 13 — Step 4: Governance (Human API / Interacture)  
**Headline:** Clarity on “who decides what, when, and how”  
- Decision flows  
- RACI-style mapping  
- Crisis roles  
- Documentation of workflows  
- Onboarding playbooks

**Speaker Notes:**  
Almost every incident we see stems from unclear roles, not from a lack of tools.

---

## Slide 14 — Step 5: Crisis & Incident Readiness  
**Headline:** A calm plan for bad days  
- First-hour playbooks  
- First 24-hour actions  
- Contact tree  
- Recovery sequencing  
- Communication templates

**Speaker Notes:**  
The goal is calm, clarity, and speed — not panic and improvisation.

---

## Slide 15 — Step 6: Ongoing Advisory  
**Headline:** Quiet oversight that keeps things aligned  
- Monthly or quarterly risk check-ins  
- Vendor review  
- Family travel patterns  
- Device lifecycle  
- Changes to staff, advisors, or vendors  
- Special events: liquidity, transitions, acquisitions

**Speaker Notes:**  
Most families want a trusted partner keeping an eye on the whole picture — not
just reacting when something goes wrong.

---

## Slide 16 — Deliverables  
**Headline:** What you receive  
- Executive summary  
- Heatmap of risk posture  
- 90-day action plan  
- Vendor evaluations

**Headline:** Typically 30–60 days for initial work  
- Week 1: Kickoff  
- Weeks 2–3: Interviews + document review  
- Weeks 3–4: Analysis  
- Weeks 4–5: Recommendations  
- Final week: Readout

**Speaker Notes:**  
We fit the schedule to the family’s availability and urgency.
