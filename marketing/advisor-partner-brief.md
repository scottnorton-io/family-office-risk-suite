# Advisor & Partner Brief  
### How We Work with You (and Never Against You)

This brief is designed for **wealth managers, investment advisors, private banks, and family office leaders** who want to bring us in as a **trusted, behind-the-scenes risk and governance partner**.

---

## Our Role

We act as a **specialist extension of your team** for:

- Cyber and privacy risk  
- Vendor and WealthTech risk  
- Governance and operating model  
- Incident readiness and response  

We do **not**:

- Compete for investment, planning, or legal work.  
- Attempt to unseat existing core vendors without cause.  
- Flood your client with security jargon or noise.

Our job is to **protect the relationship** and **enhance your value** by bringing structure and expertise to risk and governance.

## Engagement Models

1. **Advisor-Led HNWI Engagements**
   - You remain the primary relationship owner.  
   - We operate in the background and in joint meetings where needed.  
   - Deliverables are designed so *you* can walk the client through them.

2. **Family Office Engagements**
   - For SFOs and MFOs, we work with your leadership and staff to design a governance and risk framework that aligns with your broader strategy.

3. **Platform-Level MFO Framework**
   - We help you build a repeatable, branded risk & governance framework that can be applied to multiple families.

---

## What You Can Expect

- **No surprises.** We keep you informed and aligned before major conversations.  
- **Shared language.** We design materials that make you look stronger, not sidelined.  
- **Actionable recommendations.** We avoid abstract frameworks that don’t translate into decisions.  
- **Respect for your time.** Our process is structured, predictable, and light on unnecessary meetings.

---

## How We Make You Look Good

- Clarify complex risk topics for your clients in a calm, practical way.  
- Surface high-value, non-product opportunities (e.g., governance refresh, succession risk) that align with your broader mandate.  
- Help your platform differentiate on **trust, governance, and resilience**, not just investment performance.

## A Typical Flow (HNWI via Advisor)

1. **You identify a need**  
   - A fraud scare, a breach in news, new wealth event, or growing complexity.

2. **We run a structured discovery**  
   - Using our `sales/discovery-script-sfo-mfo-hnwi.md` with you and, when appropriate, the client.

3. **We propose a scoped engagement**  
   - Clear outcomes, timelines, and responsibilities.  
   - You remain the face to the client.

4. **We deliver quietly and clearly**  
   - You join key meetings as you see fit.  
   - We equip you with talking points and summaries.

5. **We support ongoing governance**  
   - Quarterly or semi-annual check-ins.  
   - Incident readiness and advisory as needed.

---

## What We Need from You

- A clear understanding of your role and boundaries with the client.  
- Early visibility into upcoming life or liquidity events that may change risk exposure.  
- Honest feedback about what will and won’t work given the client’s preferences.

## How to Introduce Us

A simple, effective framing:

> “We work with a quiet specialist who helps families like yours reduce digital, privacy, and vendor risk without adding complexity or drama. I’d like to have them take a calm, structured look at your current setup and give us both a clear roadmap.”

From there, we handle the structure and materials, while you remain at the center of the relationship.
