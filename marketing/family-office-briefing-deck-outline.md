## Slide 2 – Why We’re Having This Conversation

- Family offices manage outsized risk with lean teams.
- Most have grown faster than their risk and governance structures.
- Objective today:  
  > Share a clear, practical view of where risk lives and what you can do
  > about it — without adding noise or complexity.

## Slide 3 – The Risk Landscape for Family Offices

- Increased targeting of HNW individuals and families.
- Blurred lines between home, travel, and office tech.
- Heavy reliance on vendors and platforms.
- Regulation and expectations rising in the background.

## Slide 4 – Where Risk Actually Lives

- People and behavior (family, staff, advisors).
- Devices and accounts (phones, laptops, email, financial platforms).
- Home and travel tech (Wi-Fi, Smart TVs, assistants, hotels).
- Vendors and WealthTech platforms.
- Operating model and governance.

Callout:  
> It’s rarely one big thing. It’s a stack of small, unaddressed exposures.

## Slide 5 – Common Patterns We See

- No single owner for cyber/privacy risk.  
- Vendor risk evaluated mostly on trust and brand, not structure.  
- Critical processes live “in people’s heads”.  
- Past incidents quietly handled but never fully reviewed.  

Optional anonymized example.

- A realistic plan for “if something goes wrong.”
