## Purpose

Give trusted advisors a simple way to:

---

## 1. Who We Are

Short, calm positioning:

> We are a quiet risk and governance advisory partner for family offices. We
> focus on cyber, privacy, vendor risk, and operating model clarity. We do not
> replace existing advisors or platforms — we help them work more safely and
> effectively.

---

## 2. What Problems We Solve

- Unclear cyber and privacy exposure for principals and families.
- Hidden risks in household tech, travel, and personal devices.
- Overreliance on vendors without structured risk review.
- Operational fragility: key processes live “in people’s heads.”
- Lack of a single, independent view of risk across the office.

**We complement:**

- Wealth managers and portfolio strategists.
- Tax, legal, and estate planning advisors.

## 5. Ideal Client Profiles

Signals that a client may benefit from an introduction:

- Recent liquidity event or generational wealth transfer.
- New or rapidly growing family office.
- Increasing dependence on multiple vendors and platforms.
- Concern about cyber/privacy risk but no internal owner.
- Frequent “we should really get to that” conversations about security or
  process, with no progress.

## 6. How to Introduce Us

Make it easy and light-touch:

- Sample email template the advisor can send to their client.
- Short bio + 2–3 sentence description.
- Option for a joint intro call with the advisor on the line.

---

## 7. How We Protect the Advisor Relationship

Reassurances:

- We are not in the investment or product business.
- We will not solicit business that competes with the advisor.
- We always position the advisor as central to the relationship.
- We provide the advisor with high-level insights (with client consent) to help
  them serve better.

---

## 8. What to Expect After an Introduction

- We schedule a short, confidential discovery call with the client.
- We clarify whether there is a fit and what type of help is relevant.
- We circle back to the advisor (with client consent) on next steps.
