# Family Office Risk & Governance Suite  
### Quiet, Expert Oversight for Modern Wealth

We help family offices and their trusted advisors reduce **cyber, privacy, and operational risk** without adding noise, complexity, or vendor fatigue.

## Who We Serve

- **High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWI / Principals)**  
  Served primarily **through their trusted advisors**—investment, legal, banking, or family office-lite.

- **Single-Family Offices (SFOs)**  
  Dedicated teams supporting one family with complex structures, assets, and relationships.

- **Multi-Family Offices (MFOs)**  
  Platforms serving multiple families, where differentiated risk governance can be a competitive edge.

## The Problem

Modern wealth lives in a messy, interconnected ecosystem:

- Online banking, custodians, and WealthTech platforms.  
- Personal devices, home networks, and travel patterns.  
- A growing list of vendors, staff, and counterparties.  

Risks show up as:

- Account takeover, fraud, and extortion attempts.  
- Data leakage from careless vendors or oversharing.  
- Confusion over “who owns what” in a crisis.  
- Security projects that create **more noise than clarity**.

Traditional security approaches are often:

- Too loud.  
- Too technical.  
- Too vendor-driven.  

We solve for that.

## Our Approach

1. **Quiet, Discreet, and Respectful**  
   We fit around existing relationships and vendors instead of trying to replace them by default.

2. **Human-First, Tech-Augmented**  
    We bring structured thinking and tools, but decisions stay with the family and their trusted advisors.

3. **Decision-Ready, Not Jargon-Heavy**  
   Every deliverable is written so that principals and advisors can make decisions without needing a translator.

4. **Repeatable, Not One-Off**  
   We build a durable risk and governance model that survives leadership changes and stressful events.

## How to Start the Conversation

For advisors and family offices:

1. Identify a recent or ongoing situation that has raised concerns (fraud attempts, vendor issues, rapid growth, or governance change).
2. Use our short discovery framework (`sales/discovery-script-sfo-mfo-hnwi.md`) to structure an initial conversation.
3. If appropriate, we will propose a quiet, scoped baseline engagement with clear outcomes and timelines.

We are not a loud vendor or a checkbox exercise.  
We are the **quiet structure** that lets modern wealth operate with confidence.
