# Positioning: Family Office Risk & Governance

## Who We Serve

- Single-family offices (SFOs)
- Multi-family offices (MFOs)
- High-net-worth families operating through advisors

Especially those with:

- Complex financial and personal lives,
- Significant reliance on third-party vendors,
- Limited internal cyber/compliance capacity, and
- A strong preference for discretion and simplicity.

## Core Problem We Solve

Family offices carry outsized cyber, privacy, and operational risk compared to
their staffing level. They depend on a tangle of vendors and technology, often
without a trusted, independent view of their true exposure.

## Our Promise

> We quietly help family offices reduce cyber, privacy, and operational risk —
> without adding complexity, noise, or vendor fatigue.

## Why We're Different

- **Human-first, not tool-first.**  
  We are advisors and architects, not another platform to manage.

- **Structured Human Engagement (Human API / Interacture).**  
  We clarify how people work together, not just what tools they should use.

- **Compliance and security DNA.**  
  Deep experience in PCI DSS, risk frameworks, and control design, translated
  into plain language.

- **Designed for discretion.**  
  Our work is built to be quiet, respectful, and invisible where it should be.

## One-Sentence Summary

We are the quiet, trusted partner that helps family offices see their real risk,
simplify how they operate, and protect the people and wealth they care most
about.
