# One-Pager Copy – Family Office Risk & Governance

## Headline

Quietly reducing cyber, privacy, and operational risk for family offices.

## Subheadline

We help family offices see their real exposure, simplify how they operate, and
protect the people and wealth that matter most — without adding noise, tools,
or complexity.

---

## Who We Serve

- Single-family offices (SFOs)
- Multi-family offices (MFOs)
- High-net-worth families operating through trusted advisors

Especially where:

- Complexity has grown faster than structure,
- Reliance on vendors and technology is high,
- Internal cyber / compliance capacity is limited, and
- Discretion and simplicity are non-negotiable.

---

## The Problem

Family offices carry outsized cyber, privacy, and operational risk compared to
their staffing level.

- Household tech, travel, and personal devices create unseen vulnerabilities.
- Vendors and WealthTech platforms are trusted without being truly vetted.
- Critical decisions depend on undocumented knowledge held by a few people.
- There is no single, quiet, independent view of risk.

---

## Our Role

We act as your quiet, independent risk and governance partner.

- We map where you are exposed — people, tech, vendors, and process.
- We translate technical and compliance detail into simple, decision-ready
  language.
- We design practical, repeatable ways of working that survive turnover and
  growth.

No dashboards to learn. No noisy alerts. Just clear guidance and
board-ready insight.

## How We Work

1. **Listen and learn quietly.**  
   We start with a confidential conversation to understand your priorities,
   family dynamics, and current posture.

2. **Assess without disruption.**  
   We minimize noise and calendar impact. Most work is done in the background,
   with targeted interviews and reviews.

3. **Deliver clarity.**  
   We bring you concise, executive-ready insights: what matters, why it
   matters, and what to do next.

4. **Stay as involved as you need.**  
   Some clients ask us in for a single assessment; others keep us on as a
   trusted advisor for years.

## What You Can Expect

- Plain language, no jargon.
- Discreet engagement and minimal visibility beyond those you choose.
- Practical, prioritized recommendations, not checklists for their own sake.
- A partner who understands both controls and the human side of running a
  family office.
