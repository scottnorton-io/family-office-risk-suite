# Partner Pack – Family Office Risk & Governance

**Audience:**  
Wealth managers, RIAs, estate planning attorneys, CPAs, private bankers, and
other professionals serving family offices and high-net-worth families.

**Purpose:**  
Give you a clear understanding of what we do, where we fit, and how to
introduce us to clients in a way that protects and strengthens your
relationship.

---

## 1. Who We Are

We are a quiet, independent advisor focused on **family office risk and
governance**:

- Cyber and privacy posture
- Vendor and WealthTech risk
- Governance and operating model clarity (“who decides what, how, and when”)
- Crisis and incident readiness
- Ongoing trusted advisory

We do **not** manage assets, sell financial products, or provide legal or tax
advice. Our only job is to make your clients’ world safer, clearer, and more
resilient.

---

## 2. The Problems We Help Solve

Your clients may be asking — explicitly or silently — questions like:

- “Are we exposed in ways we don’t understand?”
- “How risky are the vendors and platforms we rely on?”
- “What happens if something goes wrong with a key person or system?”
- “Do we actually have a plan for a bad day?”

Common patterns we see:

- No clear owner for cyber/privacy risk.
- Significant reliance on vendors, with limited independent oversight.
- Blurred lines between personal and professional systems.
- Key processes living in people’s heads, not in documentation.
- Past “close calls” that prompted concern, but not structural change.

We provide a **structured, calm way** to address these issues.

---

## 3. Where We Fit (and Where We Don’t)

### We complement you when:

- You want your clients to be safer without becoming a tech helpdesk.
- You’ve raised questions about risk, but the client hasn’t acted.
- A liquidity event, generational transfer, or restructuring is underway.
- There’s increasing complexity of vendors, platforms, and data flows.

### We are **not**:

- An RIA or investment manager.
- A replacement for legal or tax counsel.
- A software platform, MSSP, or managed IT provider.

We sit **alongside** you, focused on:

- Clarity of risk
- Quality of decisions
- Resilience of the family office as an operating system

---

## 4. Typical Engagements

### 4.1 Family Office Cyber & Privacy Posture Review (Flagship)

A 30–60 day, fixed-scope engagement that answers:

- Where are we exposed?  
- What matters most?  
- What should we do first?

**Why partners like it:**  
It creates clarity without requiring you to become a security expert.

---

### 4.2 HNWI Cyber & Privacy Protection

Focused on principals and family:

- Device and account hardening
- Privacy and exposure reduction
- Practical digital hygiene

**Why partners like it:**  
It reduces the chances that a personal compromise becomes a financial or
reputational problem across the whole relationship.

---

### 4.3 Vendor & WealthTech Risk Oversight

Independent, plain-language assessment of critical vendors:

- Custodians
- RIAs and subadvisors
- WealthTech platforms
- Tax, trust, and legal services

**Why partners like it:**  
You can confidently say, “We’ve had an independent look at this.”

---

### 4.4 Governance & Operating Model (“Human API”)

Clarifying:

- Roles and responsibilities
- Decision flows
- Who does what when things go wrong
- How new people are onboarded into the office

**Why partners like it:**  
The office becomes easier to work with, more predictable, and more resilient —
which makes your own work smoother.

---

### 4.5 Crisis & Incident Readiness

We help clients avoid improvising in the middle of a crisis.

- First-hour and first-24-hour playbooks
- Escalation paths and contact trees
- Tabletop exercises

---

### 4.6 Ongoing Trusted Advisory

Long-term, quiet oversight:

- Regular risk check-ins
- Vendor and platform changes
- Support during major events

---

## 5. Ideal Clients (Signals & Triggers)

**Strong fit signals:**

- Newly formed or rapidly evolving family office.
- Recent or upcoming liquidity event.
- Expansion into new jurisdictions, asset classes, or structures.
- Family members who travel frequently or are in the public eye.
- A principal who asks “Are we protected?” and doesn’t get a clear answer.

**Common triggers for an introduction:**

- A close call (e.g., attempted fraudulent wire, phishing incident).
- Vendor changes or platform migrations.
- Leadership or key staff turnover.
- New family members becoming more active in the office.

---

## 6. How to Introduce Us

You can keep it very simple and low-pressure.

### Option 1 – Email introduction (you → client → us cc’d)

**Short version:**

> I work with a quiet, independent specialist who helps family offices get a
> clear view of cyber, privacy, and vendor risk — and put simple, practical
> guardrails in place. They don’t sell products or manage assets.  
>  
> If you’re open to it, I’d be happy to introduce you for a short, confidential
> conversation to see if there’s a fit.

*(We’ve provided a full sample email in
`marketing/sample-intro-email-for-advisors.md`.)*

---

### Option 2 – Warm mention during a review meeting

Example phrasing:

> “As your world has become more complex — more vendors, more devices, more
> people involved — I’d feel better if we had an independent view of your
> overall risk posture. I work with someone I trust who focuses specifically on
> this for family offices. Would you like me to arrange an introduction for a
> quiet conversation?”

---

### Option 3 – Invite us to a joint briefing

You can invite us to deliver a **Family Office Risk Briefing** to your client
or a small group of families. This can:

- Deepen your relationship
- Demonstrate proactive stewardship
- Create natural follow-up conversations

We can frame the session explicitly as **“hosted in partnership with you”**.

---

## 7. How We Protect Your Relationship

We are **extremely careful** to support — not compete with — your role.

- We do not manage assets, solicit capital, or sell investment products.
- We will not position ourselves as an alternative to your work.
- We keep you informed (with the client’s permission) so you remain central.
- Our reach and scope are clearly defined in advance.

If a client asks for services outside our lane (investment, legal, tax), we
refer back to you.

---

## 8. What Your Clients Can Expect

**Tone:** calm, private, non-judgmental  
**Style:** structured, practical, no jargon  
**Focus:** clarity, prioritization, and realistic plans

We’re not there to scare anyone. We’re there to:

- Bring order to complexity
- Help them understand their risk picture
- Move the most important items forward

---

## 9. What You Can Expect

- A partner who makes you look good
- Fewer “fire drills” and reactive scrambles
- A more resilient and organized client environment
- Additional talking points for your own value proposition

---

## 10. Next Steps for Partners

If you have a client in mind who might benefit from this, we suggest:

1. Send them a short note using the template provided.  
2. If they’re open to it, make a brief email introduction.  
3. We’ll take it from there, and keep you in the loop (with their permission).

If you’d like to experience the process yourself first, we can walk through a
short, example engagement or provide a tailored briefing.
