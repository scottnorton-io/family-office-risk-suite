# Family Office Risk & Governance

## Quietly reducing cyber, privacy, and operational risk for family offices.

Family offices carry outsized risk compared to their staffing level.  
We help you see your true exposure, simplify how you operate, and protect the
people and wealth that matter most — without adding noise, tools, or complexity.

---

## Who We Serve

- Single-family offices (SFOs)  
- Multi-family offices (MFOs)  
- High-net-worth families operating through their trusted advisors  

We’re a fit when:

- Complexity has outgrown structure,  
- Vendors and platforms are critical but not deeply vetted, and  
- Cyber and privacy risk are “on the list” but don’t have a clear owner.

## What We Do

### 1. Cyber & Privacy Posture Review

A focused assessment of your current risk posture across people, devices,
vendors, and processes — with a practical 90-day action plan.

**Outcome:**  
You know where you’re exposed, what matters most, and what to do first.

---

### 2. HNWI Cyber & Privacy Protection

Personal protection for principals and families — devices, accounts, home tech,
travel, and everyday digital behavior.

**Outcome:**  
The people you care most about are safer online, with simple, sustainable
habits.

---

### 3. Vendor & WealthTech Risk Oversight

Independent, plain-language assessment of your most critical vendors and
platforms.

**Outcome:**  
You can make confident decisions about who you rely on, backed by structured
risk review.

---

### 4. Governance & Operating Model (Human API / Interacture)

Clarity on who decides what, how work gets done, and how your office can scale
without becoming fragile.

**Outcome:**  
Less dependence on a few key people, more continuity and resilience.

---

### 5. Crisis & Incident Readiness

Scenario-based playbooks and simulations so that the first hour of an incident
is calm, not chaotic.

**Outcome:**  
You don’t have to invent a plan in the middle of a crisis.

---

### 6. Ongoing Trusted Advisory

A long-term relationship where we quietly watch the risk horizon, stress-test
key decisions, and support you as your world changes.

**Outcome:**  
You have a trusted, independent voice focused on risk, governance, and
protection — not just performance.
