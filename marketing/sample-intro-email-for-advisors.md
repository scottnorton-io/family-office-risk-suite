Hi [Client Name],

I wanted to introduce you to someone I trust around **family office risk,
cybersecurity, and governance**.

As your [advisor/wealth manager/attorney/CPA], I see more families wrestling
with questions like:

- “Are we exposed in ways we don’t understand?”
- “How risky are the vendors and platforms we rely on?”
- “What happens if something goes wrong or a key person isn’t available?”

Rather than trying to turn my team into cybersecurity specialists, I partner
with a quiet, independent advisor who focuses specifically on:

- Cyber and privacy posture for family offices
- Vendor and WealthTech risk oversight
- Governance and operating model clarity (“who decides what, and how”)
- Crisis and incident readiness

They don’t sell products or platforms; their role is **clarity and structure**.

If you’re open to it, I’d be happy to arrange a short, confidential
conversation so you can see if there’s a fit. No obligation — just an expert
perspective and some structured ways of thinking about risk.

Would you like me to make an introduction?

Best,
