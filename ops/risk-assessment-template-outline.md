# Risk Assessment Template – Outline

This document defines the **outline and key sections** for our risk assessment report for family office clients.

It is a skeleton; for each client, we instantiate this in our preferred authoring tool.

---

## 1. Cover & Executive Summary

- **Client name / code name**  
- **Date**  
- **Authors / contributors**  

**Executive Summary (1–2 pages):**

- High-level posture (e.g., “Generally sound with specific exposure in X”).  
- Top 3–5 findings.  
- Top 3–7 recommended actions (90-day).  
- Any immediate items that require rapid attention.

---

## 2. Context & Scope

- Brief description of the family or office (without sensitive detail).  
- Entities and key stakeholders included in scope.  
- Work performed (interviews, document reviews, technical checks).  
- Explicit out-of-scope items.

---

## 3. Environment Overview

- **People & Roles:** High-level description of who does what today.  
- **Key Systems & Vendors:** Major platforms, custodians, banks, WealthTech, IT providers.  
- **Information & Assets:** Where key information lives and how it is used.

Simple diagrams or tables can be included for clarity.

---

## 4. Risk Themes & Findings

Organize findings into themes, for example:

- Identity & Access Management  
- Devices & Networks (home, office, travel)  
- Data Protection & Privacy  
- Vendor & WealthTech Risk  
- Governance & Decision-Making  
- Incident Readiness  

For each theme:

- **Summary:** 1–2 paragraphs in plain language.  
- **Findings:** List of specific findings, numbered (R1, R2, …).  
- **Impact:** Why it matters in this context (not generic).  
- **Recommendations:** Practical, context-aware actions.

---

## 5. Risk Register Snapshot

Provide a structured table with:

- ID (R1, R2, …)  
- Description  
- Likelihood (qualitative)  
- Impact (qualitative)  
- Priority (e.g., High / Medium / Low)  
- Owner (who should own remediation)  
- Target timeline

The detailed risk register can live in a separate file or system; this section is a snapshot.

---

## 6. Governance & Operating Model Assessment

Summarize:

- Current decision models (who is first call, who approves what).  
- Strengths in governance today.  
- Gaps and risks (e.g., over-reliance on one person, unclear escalation).  
- Opportunities for simplification and clarity.

Connect this to the Interacture framework where useful.

---

## 7. Recommended Roadmap

Split into:

- **0–90 Days (Stabilization):**  
  - Quick wins and urgent fixes.  
  - Any necessary vendor changes or configuration hardening.

- **3–12 Months (Structural Improvements):**  
  - Governance build-out.  
  - Broader changes to vendors, workflows, or processes.

- **12+ Months (Strategic Options):**  
  - Larger platform or structural changes.  
  - Long-term modernizations and resilience measures.

Use simple tables or bullet lists, not Gantt charts.

---

## 8. Incident Readiness Snapshot

- Current state (no plan, informal plan, documented plan, tested plan).  
- Key gaps in readiness (e.g., who calls whom, what to do first, legal/insurance alignment).  
- Recommended next steps (e.g., tabletop exercise, playbook tailoring).

---

## 9. Closing Notes

Close with:

- Reassurance that risk can be managed in a calm, methodical way.  
- Emphasis on governance and decision-making as the lasting outcome.  
- Clear next steps (e.g., review meeting, remediation planning session).

This outline should be reused across clients for consistency and refined as we learn what resonates best.
