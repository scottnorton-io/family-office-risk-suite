# Delivery Playbook – Foundation

This playbook describes **how we deliver** the Family Office Risk & Governance Suite in practice.

It complements the higher-level cadence in `docs/delivery-cadence-and-roadmap.md` and is intended for internal use by the delivery team.

---

## 1. Roles on Our Side

Typical internal roles:

- **Engagement Lead** – Owns client relationship, scope, and quality.  
- **Risk & Governance Specialist** – Leads assessment, governance design, and reporting.  
- **Technical Partner / SME** – Provides deep technical input as needed (e.g., network, identity).  
- **Coordinator / Project Support** – Tracks tasks, follows up, and maintains documentation.

For smaller engagements, one person may wear multiple hats.

---

## 2. Core Artifacts (Internal)

Maintain the following for every client:

- **Engagement Overview** – Scope, objectives, constraints, key stakeholders.  
- **Contact Map** – Names, roles, preferred channels, time zones, escalation paths.  
- **Risk Register** – Central list of identified risks, status, and owners.  
- **Decision Log** – Key decisions, rationale, and who agreed.  
- **Governance Documents** – Charter, RACI, interaction maps, and calendar drafts.  

Store these in the designated secure workspace (e.g., Notion, Fieldguide, or similar).

---

## 3. Intake Checklist

Before starting substantive work, confirm:

- [ ] Scope and objectives documented and acknowledged.  
- [ ] Primary and backup points of contact identified.  
- [ ] Any sensitive constraints noted (e.g., specific vendors or topics to treat carefully).  
- [ ] Legal/contractual baselines in place (NDA/MSA as required).  
- [ ] Secure channels agreed (for documents, credentials, and sensitive discussions).

## 4. Assessment Playbook (Baseline Phase)

**Step 1 – Plan Interviews and Reviews**

- Identify target interviewees (family office leads, advisors, key staff, vendor contacts).  
- Prepare tailored interview guides (based on `sales/discovery-script-sfo-mfo-hnwi.md`).  
- Schedule sessions in logical sequences (e.g., advisor context before vendor details).

**Step 2 – Run Interviews**

- Use a calm, low-drama tone.  
- Capture:
  - Current practices and pain points.  
  - Informal workarounds and “how things really happen.”  
  - Dependencies on specific people or vendors.  
- Tag notes by theme: *cyber/privacy*, *vendor*, *governance*, *incident*.

**Step 3 – Collect and Review Artifacts**

- Relevant policies or process notes (if they exist).  
- High-level architecture or vendor lists.  
- Any recent incident reports or post-mortems.

**Step 4 – Analyze & Synthesize**

- Populate or update the risk register.  
- Draft a governance maturity snapshot (aligned with `docs/operating-model-interacture.md`).  
- Identify quick wins vs. structural issues.

**Step 5 – Prepare Baseline Report**

- Keep it visually simple and written in plain language.  
- Highlight:
  - 3–5 top findings.  
  - 3–7 priority actions (90-day).  
  - 3–7 structural improvements (12-month).

## 5. Remediation & Governance Build-Out

**Step 1 – Co-Design Remediation Plan**

- Present options and trade-offs.  
- Respect appetite for change and operational constraints.  
- Document agreed actions, owners, and timing.

**Step 2 – Work with Existing Providers**

- Coordinate with IT/security providers for technical changes.  
- Provide clear, concise technical guidance as needed.  
- Avoid undermining or surprising existing vendors.

**Step 3 – Design Governance Artifacts**

- Draft governance charter, RACI, and interaction maps.  
- Iterate with key stakeholders (family office leads, advisors).  
- Compress where possible: short, legible docs beat long, unread ones.

**Step 4 – Validate with Scenarios**

- Use a small set of realistic scenarios (fraud attempt, vendor outage, travel incident).  
- Walk through how the governance model handles each scenario.  
- Adjust artifacts based on feedback.

---

## 6. Ongoing Advisory

**Cadence:**

- Quarterly or semi-annual governance & risk reviews.  
- Defined response window for incident support.  
- Optional annual tabletop exercises.

**Core Activities:**

- Review changes in vendors, staff, assets, and geographies.  
- Update risk register and governance documents.  
- Capture and review incidents and near-misses.  
- Reconfirm contact and escalation details.

---

## 7. Reporting Framework

For recurring reports:

- **Executive Summary Page:**
  - Current risk posture (simple status view).  
  - Major changes since last review.  
  - Top 3–5 items to watch or decide.

- **Detail Sections (as needed):**
  - Risk register changes.  
  - Vendor and WealthTech updates.  
  - Governance adjustments.  
  - Incident summaries and AAR highlights.

Keep length proportional to audience:  
- Principals get concise summaries.  
- Family office leaders and MFO teams may want more detail.

---

## 8. Exit & Transition

If an engagement winds down or transitions:

- Deliver a **final summary** of current posture and open items.  
- Ensure governance documents and risk registers are up to date.  
- Provide clear instructions on what the client or advisor needs to maintain going forward.

---

## 9. Continuous Improvement

Internally, after major engagements or incidents:

- Run a short review:
  - What worked well?  
  - What created friction?  
  - Which templates or scripts need updating?  
- Capture improvements in this playbook and related documents.

This playbook is a living document and should evolve as we learn from real engagements.
