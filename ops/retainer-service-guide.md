> This guide is intended for internal alignment and to set clear expectations
> with clients.

## 1. Purpose of the Retainer

- Provide a quiet, consistent point of contact for risk, governance, and
  operational questions.
- Maintain context over time so advice becomes more tailored and effective.
- Avoid “starting from zero” each time something changes or goes wrong.

---

## 2. Core In-Scope Activities

Retainer typically includes:

- Regular check-ins (monthly or quarterly).
- Review of:
  - Changes to vendors and platforms.
  - New initiatives or projects with risk implications.
  - Notable incidents or close calls.
- Advisory input on:
  - Risk and control tradeoffs.
  - Governance and operating model decisions.
  - Crisis or incident response decisions (as they arise).

---

## 3. Out-of-Scope Activities (Unless Explicitly Added)

To avoid confusion:

- Full new assessments or large-scale reviews.
- Major governance redesigns or Interacture buildouts.
- Deep technical implementation work.
- Legal or tax advice (we are not counsel).

These can be scoped as separate projects when needed.

  - Monthly or quarterly video/phone meeting.
  - Standing agenda (risk horizon, key changes, actions).
- **As-needed support:**
