# Incident Readiness Playbook – Outline

This outline provides a structure for client-specific incident readiness playbooks.

It is not a legal document or formal IR plan; it is a **practical guide** for how the family, office, advisors, and vendors should respond during stressful events.

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

- Clarify the types of incidents covered (e.g., fraud attempts, account compromise, data breaches, extortion, vendor incidents).  
- Clarify what is **not** covered or where other plans (e.g., corporate IR plans) take precedence.

---

## 2. Roles & Contacts

- **Primary Contacts:**  
  - For the principal or family.  
  - For the family office or MFO team.  
  - For IT/security provider(s).  
  - For legal counsel.  
  - For banks/custodians/insurers (as practical).

- **Escalation Paths:**  
  - Who calls whom first for specific incident types.  
  - Backup contacts if primary is unavailable.

Keep this section simple and easy to update.

---

## 3. General Response Principles

- Stay calm; slow down the decision just enough to avoid mistakes.  
- Preserve evidence (do not wipe devices or logs without guidance).  
- Avoid making commitments or admissions without legal input.  
- Use agreed secure channels for sensitive communication.

---

## 4. Scenario Playbooks (Examples)

For each priority scenario, outline:

1. **Signal & Examples** – How we might notice this.  
2. **Immediate Actions (First 0–2 Hours)** – Simple, concrete actions.  
3. **Stabilization (First 2–24 Hours)** – Additional steps, coordination, notifications.  
4. **Follow-Up (Next 1–7 Days)** – Reviews, vendor involvement, documentation.

Example scenarios:

- Suspected account takeover or fraud attempt.  
- Suspicious email or message leading to potential compromise.  
- Vendor data breach affecting client information.  
- Extortion or ransom attempt.  
- Loss or theft of a device with sensitive access.

---

## 5. Coordination with Advisors & Vendors

- How and when to involve:
  - Legal counsel.  
  - Banks and custodians.  
  - Insurers (e.g., cyber insurance where applicable).  
  - IT/security providers.  

Emphasize:

- No surprises: keep key advisors in the loop.  
- Clear division of responsibilities (aligned with governance documents).

---

## 6. Documentation & After-Action Review

- Minimal set of facts to capture for each incident:
  - What happened?  
  - How did we discover it?  
  - What did we do?  
  - What was the impact?  
  - What will we change going forward?

- Use this to:
  - Update risk register.  
  - Adjust governance and playbooks.  
  - Inform future training or awareness.

---

## 7. Testing & Refresh

- Recommend an **annual tabletop exercise** using one or two priority scenarios.  
- After each test:
  - Update contacts, steps, and communications.  
  - Confirm people are comfortable with their roles.

This outline should be tailored for each client with specific contacts, vendors, and scenarios based on their environment.
